            You are given exactly 2 frames from the same apical four-chamber echocardiogram. The first frame has index 0 and the second one is 1.
            The order of the frames is arbitrary and does NOT indicate which one is EDV or ESV. 
            Exactly one frame is EDV (largest Left Ventricle cavity) and the other is ESV (smallest Left Ventricle cavity). 
            Only use these 2 frames. 
            Decide which frame is EDV, that shows the largest Left Ventricle cavity. 
            Reply exactly as: EDV=<int>.

            Output requirements: 
            Use only indices 0 and 1.
            Output exactly one line. Output format must be exactly: EDV=<int>
            Do not output any explanations, extra words, or a second line.
