            I sampled exactly {{NUM}} frames from the video.
            Find the frame indices of EDV (largest Left Ventricle cavity) and ESV (smallest Left Ventricle cavity) from input frames indexing ranging in [{{idx_low}}, {{idx_high}}].
            Left ventricle is marked as red region in all the frames. 
            Only use these {{NUM}} frames. 
            Decide which frame is EDV, that has the largest red region area. 
            Decide which frame is ESV, that has the smallest red region area. 
            Reply exactly as: Frame: EDV=<int>, ESV=<int>.

            You must not say things like 'Okay' or explain what you are doing.Output only one line in this exact format:
