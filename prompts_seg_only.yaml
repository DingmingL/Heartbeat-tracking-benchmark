            I sampled exactly {{NUM}} frames from the video. Ignore all background details, anatomy, or medical context.
            Focus on the red region drawn on top of the images.
            Identify the index of the frame with the LARGEST and SMALLEST red area from input frames indexing ranging in [{{idx_low}}, {{idx_high}}].
            Only use these {{NUM}} frames. 
            Reply exactly as: Frame: LARGEST_AREA_INDEX=<int>, SMALLEST_AREA_INDEX=<int>.
