            You are given exactly 2 frames from the same apical four-chamber echocardiogram. The first frame has index 0 and the second one is 1.
            Both images contain a red overlay region. 

            Your Task:
            1. Compare the total area of the red region in Image 0 vs Image 1.
            2. Determine which image has the LARGEST red area.
          
            Output Requirements:
            Do not provide reasoning. Output exactly one line in the format: LARGEST_AREA_INDEX=<0 or 1>
